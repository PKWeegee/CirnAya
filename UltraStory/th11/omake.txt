After a hard faithless winter, everyone in Gensokyo is relieved to
move forwards to a calm spring.
Yet after a few days, the unthinkable happened.
A gigantic flame pillar shot out of the hole leading to the underground.
It only lasted a few seconds, yet its height was visible from all across of Gensokyo.

Not long after, Doremy Sweet has called many youkai and other oddities to the Hakurei Shrine.

Doremy: "So, we all saw this flame pillar, yes?"
Reimu: "Of course, we aren't blind."
Doremy: "I'm convinced that this was the work of another dream dweller."
Marisa: "What a twist."
Doremy: "That's why I want Reimu and Marisa to head down there to investigate."
Reimu: "Are you nuts? Wouldn't that be extremely dangerous?"
Doremy: "Indeed, that's why I'm letting Yukari tamper with your options, so you can communicate."
Yukari: "It's like back then, Reimu. Remember?"
Suika: "Yeah, I do. You had to choose between one of us three. I forgot who you picked."
Aya: "It doesn't matter, she should be able to rely on all of us."
Marisa: "Ah, so that's why the doll master, asthma cannon, and cucumber eater are here as well."
Alice,Patchouli,Nitori: "Shut up."
Marisa: "Yeesh, can't yall take a joke?"
Doremy: "Either way...you two should be on your way. We can't waste any time here!"

And so, the two dove into the still burning hole, leading deep into the underground.
What damages has the fire caused, how deep will they have to go?
And most importantly...what awaits them at the bottom?
