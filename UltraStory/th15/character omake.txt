Lucy Dream
Species: Alph
Abilty: Manipulation of Dreams

As the one and only administrator of the deep dream realm, she was forced to
relocate to the regular dream realm, after the dream rebellion began,
and the master made her base in the deep dream realm's castle.

Now she is doing her best to maintain balance and order, to prevent the
dream realm from falling apart.
