After gaining a new teammate in the form of Kusanagi no Kusachi,
Doremy is preparing to return to the dream realm, together with Reimu, Marisa, and Kusachi.

Doremy: Alright, that should be everything.
Kusa: Yeah, the portal is open, and we have all the shards we need.
Reimu: And you will act as the final key, right?
Kusa: Exactly. And once we establish the direct link to our final goal, we can deploy our two secret weapons.
Marisa: Still can't believe that those two will be the secret weapon.
Doremy: I'm sure there is a reason, and we'll find out soon enough.
Kusa: We should not be careless though, who knows what things we will find once we enter.
Marisa: I'll still go in guns blazing.
Reimu: When ever do you not do that?
Doremy: Should we be off then?


And so, these four set out to their final journey, to finally end the rebellion.
However, they are yet unaware of their last roadblock, which they must dispel.
