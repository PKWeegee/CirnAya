It's the annual harvest festival, and even the dream rebellion hasn't stopped it from happening.
Yet one thing has become obviously strange...
The harvest this year is TOO good.
While this may be a cause for celebration under normal circumstances,
the residents of Gensokyo were quick to blame this on the dream dwellers.

It may not seem like a harmful change, yet anything could be suspicious in the current state of Gensokyo.
During the five days of the harvest festival, many well known figures shall
roam around, to try and get behind the mysteries of this years harvest.

The secrets...of the harvest abundance.
