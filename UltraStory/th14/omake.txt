A regular summer's day in Gensokyo, leaves are gently gliding downwards onto the water,
youkai are minding their own buisness, everything seems to be calm.

In the Hakurei Shrine however, an aura of unrest can be felt.

Doremy: ...And that's why both of you need to act quickly!
Reimu: Because...of a cherry petal?
Marisa: Yeah what's the big deal?
Doremy: It's summer! It should be green! The color is inverted!
Reimu: Are you sure, you aren't just overthinking this?
Doremy: No, I'm not! And you also need to search for that person the hermit mentioned.
Marisa: She did say that, but she gave us no leads.
Reimu: Well, maybe this is the lead we need...
Doremy: Now you are talking! Get going!
Marisa: Oh, and you are just gonna sit around again, huh?
Doremy: Not for long...I'll get to work soon.


The Scarlet Devil Mansion has also caught the aura of unrest,
and Sakuya was sent out to investigate the strange happenings as well.


What no one knows yet...is that they will find an unkown figure soon...in this Inverted Wonderland.
