Kusanagi no Kusachi
Species: Spirit
Abilities: Wind/Lightning Magic

As a spirit who has inhabited the legendary sword Kusanagi for ages,
she has been passed down alongside the sword, whenever it chose
a new master.
Nowadays, she has gotten quite close with her current user,
with them becoming actual friends.
She got dragged into the dream rebellion, due to her current master
starting the whole ordeal, and leaving her no choice but to follow
in her path.
But now, due to things reaching a critical moment, she chose to
head to Gensokyo, to find the people who will be able to put
a stop to it all, for her master's safety.
