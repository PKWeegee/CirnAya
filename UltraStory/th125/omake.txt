After the suprising success of Aya's first newspaper, documenting the dream dwellers,
she decided to head out once again, and make a second volume.
Hatate has caught wind of her plan, and tried to talk it over with her.

They soon came to a consensus, that they would both go out and document them,
but they would focus on different aspects of the dream dwellers.
It would be their first, and biggest collaboration,
and the relase of the Eastern Dreamer Newspaper would certainly be a hit.
