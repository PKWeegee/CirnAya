The Hakurei Shrine on a cool summer night.
Reimu and Marisa were enjoying a nice cup of tea when suddenly...

Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams, came bursting through the front door.

Doremy: "Shrine Maiden! I-I don't have alot of time to explain but..."
Reimu: "Could you at least knock?"
Doremy: "As you may know, I rule the dream world, but recently, someone has been giving all the dream dwellers immense powers."
Marisa: "Ok, and? Sounds like a fun time."
Doremy: "After a while they started attacking the border between dream and reality. I tried my best to stop them, but...
         ...it failed. They broke through, and now they are going to attack all of Gensokyo!"
Reimu: "Ugh, why is everyone useless at their jobs?! It always lands on me to sort it out."
Doremy: "I apologize deeply, but I don't know who else to turn to."
Marisa: "Me?"
Doremy: "They are a crafty bunch, but they seem to have a love for the past. Some have been sighted at the Scarlet Devil Mansion."

As Reimu and Marisa go outside, they spot a familar looking red mist.

Reimu: "This is like back then..."
Marisa: "It's been ages since I've seen that mist."
Doremy: "If you would be so kind, please solve these incidents, and I'll try my best to fix the border and put them back where they belong."
Reimu: "I suppose it is my job. Why do you have to sit around in my shrine though?"
Doremy: "It's a nice base of operations. And since it's so close to boundaries, it will be easier to observe everything."
Marisa: "You say that, but you are already half asleep in the kotatsu."
Reimu: "Whatever, let's go Marisa. The sooner this is over, the better."


And so, the two head out in the dark of night, ready to face the wrath of the dream dwellers.
Just what is their ultimate motive? Who gave them their power?
Only time will tell...
