On Gensokyo's darkest night, the Hakurei Shrine was filled to the brim with humans and youkai alike.
Overseeing the crowded room was Doremy Sweet, briefing everyone about the current events.

Doremy: "Alright, thank you all for coming on such a short notice. As you may have noticed, the moon has gone missing, leaving the night darker than ever."
Marisa: "Yeah of course, we ain't blind. Well, Reimu might be nightblind."
Reimu: "Shut it..."
Doremy: "Ahem...my point is, this is obviously the dream dwellers once again, and they seem to be mimicking the endless night incident from long ago."
Yuyuko: "Oh so that's why I was awoken from my sweet nap."
Youmu: "I had to carry her, while she was half asleep..."
Yuyuko: "She's such a good friend~"
Sakuya: "So I guess what you are saying is that we should team up like back then?"
Remilia: "Seems smart, we'll be done twice as fast."
Alice: "Does that mean I have to tug Marisa around again?"
Marisa: "You make it sound like it's a punishment."
Alice: "It is."
Doremy: "Exactly, you guys catch on quick. Now, I've gotten another shard of this gem from dream Yukari last time. I can use its power to halt the night until the moon is back."
Yukari: "I hope she wasn't too much trouble for you guys."
Reimu: "A pain, just like you always are."
Yukari: "You flatter me~"
Doremy: "Alright, get your preperations done, and head out quickly. It's not easy to use the power like this for too long."

And so, they went out into the darkness of the night. Without moonlight, everything remained darker than ever before.
They knew where to go, but the path to the bamboo filled forest will be filled with treacherous people, who want to take over the world.
