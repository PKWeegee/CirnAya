On a regular summer day in Gensokyo, some fairies started acting weird.
Shooting way more bullets, and being generally obsessed with some shards they found.

Out of the loop, Cirno suddenly felt as if her whole world got a new coat of paint.
Confused by this, she decided to head out, and see what was going on.

Yet she shoult not overestimate her freezing skills, because if she overdoes it, it could
cause irreversible damage.
