As one of the four horseriders of the apocalypse, the embodiment of death
is a fearful nightmare being. It has dawned the appearance of Eika Ebisu,
as per the request of their new master.

Nightmare Urumi Ushizaki
Embodiment of Pestilence
Ability: Invoking Illness and Plagues

Another horserider of the apocalpyse, the embodiment of pestilence has
found great joy in turning a once crystal clear river, into a toxic pool
of bacteria and poisons.
Anyone brave or foolish enough to set foot above the river, is bound to be
struck by the worst illnesses known to man, with no known cure to save them.

Nightmare Kutaka Niwatari
Embodiment of Famine
Ability: Destroying Crops and Wildlife

The third horserider of the apocalpyse has made their new habitat in a 
once lush oasis in the dream realm. She soon started destroying all crops,
plants and wildlife, quickly turning the whole area into a desolate desert.
The area is vast and dry, which quickly invokes hunger and thirst, making it
extremely hard to traverse it.
