As another day in Gensokyo comes to an end, the festival celebrating the end of the Dream Rebellion concluded.
That night, several residents have experienced horrible nightmares, unlike anything they have seen before.

The next day, early in the morning, Doremy Sweet and Lucy Dream came over to the Hakurei Shrine.

Lucy: Ah, its convenient to find you three here this morning.
Doremy: We've had a situation last night. People have had horrible nightmares suddenly.
Jessica: Huh, I don't remember dreaming anything, actually.
Reimu: Well maybe you are still a bit woozy from that gem.
Marisa: Or all the booze I fed you.
Jessica: Thats why I hate drinking...
Lucy: Anyways...I need you guys to head to the Nightmare Realm to solve this problem.
Reimu: Nightmare Realm?
Marisa: Sounds spooky...
Jessica: Its a cursed realm, close to the dream realm. I never went there, since I had no reason to.
Doremy: Exactly what she said. I'll give you guys some enhancements for your dream powers. You'll need them.
Lucy: And when you find stray nightmares, be sure to collect them. Once you gather enough, you'll purify them.
Jessica: I feel like I'm obliged to solve this thing, after what I did before.
Reimu: Don't think I'll let you go in there alone. Who knows if you can handle it.
Marisa: I'm coming too, it sounds exciting!
Doremy: Be careful, the Nightmare Realm is a mostly unexplored area.
Lucy: We wish you best of luck...

And so, the group traveled back into the dream realm, hoping to soon find their way deeper into darkness than ever before.
Agents of evil have been sent out already, it won't be an easy adventure...
And at the end, the mastermind shall be revealed.
