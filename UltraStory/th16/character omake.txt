Connec
Species: Fairy
Ability: Control over Radiowaves

As a fairy who can control radiowaves, she was once found by the mastermind,
and helped her rebuild communication networks she had in her old world.

While not totally accurate, it worked really well and now she has been promoted
to stand guard at the entrance of the deep dream realm and alert the mastermind
if any suspicious activities were to take place.

=========================
Lunaa Verediem
Species: Homunculus
Ability: Magical Imitation

Originally made as the vessel for a certain goddess, she developed a soul of her own
over time and became good friends with the mastermind and her friends.

She is the princess of the realm where she stems from and eventually will have to
rise up as the queen, once the time is right.
While it seems that she depends on her imitation magic, it also appears that she
posesses alot of great potential of her own. It only needs to be unlocked...

=========================
Thicu
Species: Human(?)
Ability: Otherworldy Magic

No one really knows how she ended up here, along with the others, but all she knows
is that she thinks she's just asleep.

She was once chosen by a certain goddess to act as a hero, tasked to protect the world,
in case a second catastrophe arises, yet she often just went around doing her own things, 
ignoring the goddess' pleas.

=========================
Serenity
Species: Homunculus
Ability: Advanced Wind Magic

On the day where the rebellion began, she got dragged along, while she was still half-asleep,
so she wasn't sure what she was getting into. In hindsight, she wishes she just stayed in bed.
But now that she's here, she will do her best to help her friends in any way she can.

In her own world, she is a songstress, pushed into the position due to chaotic circumstances, 
despite how shy she truly is.
Deep down, she has a peculiar but strong connection to another one of the mastermind's friends.

=======================
Mari Ackame
Species: Vampire
Ability: Blood Magic

Born into a royal vampire family, she felt a huge hatred towards her species and discarded
her relations with her family, to pursue a life of magic instead.

She owns a small shop, where she brews magic potions and learns spells from many magical
grimoires she has found over the years. Sadly, she has gotten a bad reputation after a
little explosive incident and now, despite being extremely skilled at her craft,
she gets very few visitors in her shop.

In that time, she met the mastermind and they quickly became very close friends. Their bond
is quite unbreakable and it seems as it will only get stronger.

=======================
Seraph
Species: ???
Ability: Omen (Unkown Black Magic)

After several tragic events, he was seperated from the mastermind, only to meet her again,
in a new world, but without his memories. Despite how heartbreaking this was for the mastermind,
she took care of him until he slowly regained his memories.

On the outside, he seems very cold and rarely shows emotions, but this is only done to protect
himself. Inside, he cares very deeply about all his friends and will go to big lengths to
protect them.

Inside of him slumbers a source of dark magic, allowing him to channel his negativity into
powerful attacks. Yet he had little to no control over it and often went berserk, even getting
very close to deaths door.

=====================
Aternia
Species: God
Ability: Creation

Goddess of a world called "Ethernis", hated and hunted after she let a war between humankind 
and strange dark beasts break loose. She summoned heroes from different places to aid her, 
yet in the end they turned against her and she was forced into exile, cursed and had little 
power left. In a last ditch effort she summoned a 2nd generation of heroes to protect the 
world in her stead. The mastermind was one of the 2nd generation and instead of hunting 
her down, befriended her over time.

Due to Aternia's body breaking down by result of a curse, she required a vessel, 
which led to Lunaa becoming exactly that for her. They now share a body and live in coexistence.

Despite being a goddess, she has a playful side, loving to jokingly mess with her friends,
or teasing them in certain ways.

=====================
Jessica Puella Kaisa (Posessed)
Species: Human
Ability: Control over Dreams

Having a strong link to dreams, she once stumbled upon a tengu from Gensokyo in her dreams
and eventually a fairy as well. She was entranced by their adventures and the world itself,
leading to her starting her dream realm research.

After a while, she was told of a mythical gem, which would allow its wearer to control dreams
itself. Through unkown circumstances, she got ahold of the gem and started the rebellion.

Over time and after an adventure in a different land, she started to slowly weaken mentally,
as the gem sapped away at her sanity. She felt as if the gem itself had gotten a soul
of its own, taking over her body, to do her own evil biddings.

======================
Jessica Puella Kaisa (Nightmare Stage)
Species: Human
Ability: Dream Magic

After the first battle against the heroes, she lost her spiritual link to the lucid gem
for a while. This allowed her to regain her sanity and made her realize all the horrible
things she did while in this trance.

Now she seeks to redeem herself, by making sure that no one will have to suffer at her
hand again. She was able to harness the dark magic from Seraph into herself, in a last
ditch effort to end it all for herself.

But we can't let that happen, can we? Let's finish this incident once and for all,
without any casualties!
