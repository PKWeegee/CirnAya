Connec
Species: Fairy
Ability: Control over Radiowaves

As a fairy who can control radiowaves, she was once found by the mastermind,
and helped her rebuild communication networks she had in her old world.

While not totally accurate, it worked really well, and now she has been promoted
to stand guard at the entrance of the deep dream realm, and alert the mastermind
if any suspicious activities were to take place.

Lunaa Verediem
Species: Homunculus
Ability: Magical Imitation

Originally made as the vessel for a certain goddess, she developed a soul of her own
over time, and became good friends with the mastermind and her friens.

She is the princess of the realm where she stems from, and eventually will have to
rise up as the queen, once the time is right.
While it seems that she depends on her imitation magic, it also appears that she
posesses alot of great potential of her own. It only needs to be unlocked...

=========================
Thicu
Species: Human(?)
Ability: Otherworldy Magic

No one really knows how she ended up here, along with the others, but all she knows
is that she thinks she's just asleep.

She was once chosen by a certain goddess to act as a hero, tasked to stop a great catastrophe,
yet she often just went around doing her own things, ignoring the goddess' pleas.

Serenity
Species: Homunculus
Ability: Advanced Wind Magic

On the day where the rebellion began, she got dragged along, while she was still half-asleep,
so she wasn't sure what she was getting into. In hindsight, she wishes she just stayed in bed.
But now that she's here, she will do her best to help her friends in any way she can.

In her own world, she is a songstress, pushed into the position due to chaotic circumstances, 
despite how shy she truly is.
Deep down, she has a peculiar but strong connection to another one of the mastermind's friends.
