On the gate leading into the deep dream realm, Doremy Sweet and Lucy Dream have finished
their preperations for the final phase of their plans.

Lucy: Alright, you four will now head into the deep dream realm.
Doremy: We have given you control over dream energy. Any bullet that exists in the deep dream realm
	is filled with dream energy. You can draw from that energy, to enhance your powers.
Reimu: I sure hope this will be the end of it finally...
Marisa: Yeah, no kiddin', this has been going on for so long now.
Aya: While I don't mind a new oppertunity for a scoop, may I ask...
Cirno: Why am I here? This place looks awesome, but I'm so confused...
Aya: ...why both of us got dragged here out of the blue?
Lucy: It seems the mastermind of the incident has some connection to the two of you.
Doremy: That's why you also need to head in there to launch the attack.
Reimu: I'm not sure I get this plan fully, but you better hope it works.
Marisa: If things get too hairy, can ya guys send some backup?
Doremy: I'm not sure that's possible, since if you go too far in, we can't reach you easily.
Lucy: Trust in your strengths, and you should be fine...


And so, the four chosen ones traverse the portal into the deep dream realm...
Their toughest battle yet is only just beginning.
The mastermind...she is anticipating you.
