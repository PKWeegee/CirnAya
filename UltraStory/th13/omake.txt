Gensokyo has been blessed with many peaceful nights lately,
yet in the Hakurei Shrine, a certain baku is restless as ever...

Doremy: Have you heard the news, you two?
Marisa: What news?
Reimu: No?
Doremy: There's some kind of spirits flying around. Doesn't that remind you of something?
Reimu: Ah, the divine spirit incident...
Marisa: So it's time for that one to happen again?
Doremy: It seems that way. I suggest you two head out.
Reimu: Are you sure those are the same spirits, by the way?
Doremy: I'm not quite certain, but you should be able to use their powers still.
Marisa: That's great, I love that rush of power!
Doremy: Then there's no time to lose, go to the netherworld.
Reimu: Why there?
Doremy: To find clues, obviously.
Marisa: Seems like a waste of time to me, but sure.


Meanwhile, in the Moriya Shrine...
Kanako: And that's why you should head to the netherworld again, Sanae.
Sanae: So let me get this straight...those spirits appeared again, and there's clues in the netherworld?
Suwako: Exactly. You are such a smart girl sometimes.
Sanae: No need to be so condescending...I'll be on my way.


The netherworld already seemed quite restless though.
Yuyuko: Oh, Youmu, do me a favor...
Youmu: What is it?
Yuyuko: I feel a strong prescense of spirits around here, could you do something about them?
Youmu: Spirits? Like that one time? I'll do it!
Yuyuko: But be careful...I sense one more thing...it scares me.
Youmu: I'll...keep that in mind.

With everyone once again on the move, the stage is set for the unkown spirits to dance around,
as if they were being summoned.
At the same time...something very important seems to be forgotten, by everyone...
