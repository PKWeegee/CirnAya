A peaceful time in Gensokyo, the underground has been fully restored from the giant flame incident.
Everyone is enjoying the quiet times, but they knew it wouln't last long.

The Hakurei Shrine, where a certain baku has been stationed for quite some time now.

Doremy: Did you hear the news?
Reimu: About the Myouren Temple?
Doremy: I heard that there were lots of shards, very similar to the ones we've been gathering, flying around.
Reimu: But they are all multicolored and stuff. So what exactly are they?
Doremy: That's what I'm not sure about...

Suddenly, in a flash, Marisa busted into the room.

Marisa: Oi, Reimu, Doremy, the Myouren's flying ship has taken off again!
Reimu: It what?
Doremy: I guess this is your cue to go investigate.
Marisa: I'll beat you to the punch, Reimu.
Reimu: This isn't a competition...
Doremy: While you are there, make sure to collect lots of those shards.

Meanwhile, at the Moryia Shrine...

Kanako: Sanae, I need you here quickly.
Sanae: Yes, yes, I'm here. What's the matter?
Suwako: We want you to head to the Myouren Temple, there's some strange things happening there.
Sanae: Myouren? What would I want to do there?
Kanako: Their ship has taken off again...
Suwako: And there's a bunch of colorful shards.
Sanae: Alright, got it. I'll be on my way then.


And so, our three heroines went off towards Myouren Temple.
Where this journey would lead them...none of them had any idea.
But it shall certainly be a moment of pure remembrance...
