A long and tiring autumn has come to an end in Gensokyo.
Everyone is ready to stay at home, warming themselves under their kotatsu.

In the Hakurei Shrine, Doremy Sweet is still lingering on, trying to figure out when the dream
dwellers will strike next.

Reimu: "You know, all this plotting is unhealthy. Lay down for a while..."
Doremy: "I can't! Who knows when they will strike next!"
Reimu: "Actually, I've been wondering for a couple days now..."
Doremy: "What is it?"
Reimu: "Is it just me, or is my shrine not getting as much faith as it should?"
Doremy: "It's not getting any faith! But isn't that normal?"
Reimu: "No! There's usually a little..."

As Reimu gazed out a window, she noticed a gentle flow of faith, drifting into the sky...

Reimu: "Hey, uh, I'll be out for a while. If Marisa comes, tell her to follow the faith."
Doremy "Wait, don't just... And she's gone. Great."

A couple minutes later, a familiar black-white magician busted into the shrine.

Marisa: "Oi, what's happenin'?"
Doremy: "Something about faith missing. Reimu said that you should follow her."
Marisa: "Eh? Work? In this cold winter? Ah what the heck. Might be fun."

And so the shrine was left almost vacant, once again.
Only a lonely baku sits inside, pondering the next move of the enemy.
Unbeknownst to her, the enemy already begun moving about...
